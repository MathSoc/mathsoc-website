# Contributing to the MathSoc website rebuild

Thanks for your interest in MathSoc's website rebuild project! We gladly welcome contributions from current University of Waterloo students, and for those interested in more active involvement, applications open each semester to join the MathSoc web development team.

**We do not accept contributions from those outside of the student body of the University of Waterloo.**

## How can I contribute?

Open projects are tracked in the GitHub issues log, found [here](https://github.com/MathSoc/mathsoc-website/issues).

We will gladly consider PRs submitted by contributors outside of the development team.

In the interest of maintaining a common style throughout the codebase, please use Prettier to format your work.
You can set up Prettier in VS Code by downloading the official Prettier extension, then setting Prettier as your default formatter.
